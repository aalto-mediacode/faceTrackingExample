This is a simple example for the ofxFaceTracker addon.

Requirements:

- [ofxFaceTracker](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker)
- [ofxCv](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv)

This code is the same as I wrote in the following video:

Make sure you follow the instructions in the video to get it to compile:
- Change the XCode project settings
